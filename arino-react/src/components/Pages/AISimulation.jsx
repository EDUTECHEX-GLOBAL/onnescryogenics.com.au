          <strong>Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM)</strong> refers to a suite of
          technologies designed to store, transfer, and measure ultra-cold
          fluids such as liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, and liquid methane.
          These cryogenic fluids serve as the primary propellants for space
          exploration missions, making CFM technologies essential to future
          endeavors in both exploration and science.
        </p>

        <p className="ai-paragraph">
          To support its long-term vision for space, deep space exploration
          requires high-performance propulsion systems—including chemical,
          electric, and nuclear options. Cryogens will play a critical role in
          these systems, enabling missions ranging from Earth-to-orbit
          transportation to deep space exploration.
        </p>

        <p className="ai-heading">

            CFM integrated tank technologies will be pivotal in supporting:

          <li>Human missions to the Moon and Mars</li>

        <p className="ai-paragraph">
          Together, these capabilities will ensure the sustainability and
          efficiency of future space missions.
        </p>

        <p className="ai-paragraph">
          One of the major challenges in <strong>cryogenic fluid storage</strong> is the continual loss of
          cryogens over time, caused by their tendency to <strong>boil off at warmer temperatures</strong>. To minimize this
          loss, <strong>multilayer insulation</strong> is used as a passive
          control method. While this helps reduce boil-off for short durations,
          it is not sufficient for long-term storage.
        </p>

        <p className="ai-paragraph">
          To actively prevent heat from reaching the cryogenic propellants,<strong>cryocoolers</strong>
          are employed. These function similarly to refrigerators by removing
          heat, resulting in<strong> minimal or zero propellant loss</strong> — a system known as
a<strong> "zero-boiloff system."</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="ai-heading">
          <strong>
            Zero-boiloff technology offers significant advantages:

          Quantum AI Computational Fluid Dynamics play a key role in modelling

          Advancing Cryogenic Fluid Management for Future Space Missions
        </strong>
        <p className="ai-paragraph">
          A significant advancement beyond the current state of the art in fluid
          management is essential to make cryogenic propellants viable for use
          in high-performance nuclear thermal and chemical propulsion systems.
          These systems are critical for future long-duration space exploration
          missions.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve this advancement, Onnes is focusing on <strong>Zero Boil-Off (ZBO)</strong> and <strong>Reduced Boil-Off (RBO)</strong> strategies. Unlike current
          short-duration, gravity-insensitive, passive pressure control systems,
          ZBO and RBO rely on<strong>active operations</strong> to ensure
          reliable, cost-effective, and efficient storage and transfer of
          cryogenic propellants with <strong>minimal fuel loss.</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These advanced strategies involve a <strong>
            complex combination of dynamic forced mixing and energy removal 
          </strong> in a two-phase, multi-component propellant system. The goal is to
          control tank temperature and pressure throughout various storage and
          transfer operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          A future large-scale <strong>Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) Demonstration</strong> for
          in-space refueling will aim to test these operations. These may
          involve <strong>either segregated or interpenetrated fluid phases,</strong> which can be composed of single or multiple condensable and
          non-condensable species.
